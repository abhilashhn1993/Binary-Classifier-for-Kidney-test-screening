# Screening_test_for_CKD
The dataset here contains the patient information for identifying Chronic Kidney disease.
Here, I have used a cleaned and treated dataset containing various key health metrics like 
  age
  race
  bmi
  cholestrol levels
  diabetes history of the patient
  family history of diseases, etc.
  
Implemented a Logistic Regression classifier followed by a Random Forest classifier and identified the key metrics from the patient data to design a screening test for the early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease
